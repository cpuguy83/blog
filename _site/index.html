    <p>It&#39;s been awhile since I did a quick Docker tip, so I figured I should go ahead
and share one that I know many people will get use out of.</p>

    <p>Forget everything you thought knew about Docker networking. It&#39;s all changed,
brand new and shiney, and yet oddly familiar.
Docker 1.9 is coming and it will change the way you do container networking.</p>

<p>You may have seen some
<a href="/2015/09/15/experimenting-with-native-docker-tooling/">experiements</a> now I&#39;ll
show you the real deal.</p>

    <p>Using Docker over the last two years has been a wonderful experience. It is not
always perfect. I&#39;ve certainly had to write new tools (and use other&#39;s tools) to
deal with a missing or not-fully-baked features for my own needs. However, this
has served to allow us to focus on the next level of problems in administering
systems, be it for local dev envs, production clusters, and everything in
between.</p>

<p>Very often when talking to other developers they all agree they like the Docker
model, but the path from a simple dev env to a proudction cluster (even a small one)
is unclear.
Indeed, I tend to agree, there has not been a simple way to set this up without
rolling your own tooling (which I&#39;ve done a lot of).</p>

<p>The Docker community has been working on new tools and API&#39;s to help fill in some
of those gaps and aleviate some of the headaches with some supporting tooling
like compose, swarm, and machine, but still these aren&#39;t really production ready
yet nor the integration points completely figured out.
That is not to say don&#39;t use these tools, I use them every day. I don&#39;t
create a Digital Ocean droplet without doing it through docker-machine, for
instance.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this is somthing being worked on! I&#39;d like to show you some of it.
It is still <strong>QUITE</strong> rough around the edges, but I&#39;d expect to see some major
improvements soon, possibly even in time for for the Docker Engine 1.9 release (October).
Without further ado, let&#39;s take a look!</p>

    <p>Logging in Docker has always been quite convenient for a developer. Send your
logs to stdout/stderr and Docker picks them up, you can view them with
<code>docker logs</code>. This command lets you tail the logs, follow them, etc. It can be
really nice. 
In production scenarios this has proven to be a pain point...</p>

    <p>Data-only containers are a pattern for managing your docker volumes with
containers instead of manually with host-mounted volumes. For more info on the
pattern, see
<a href="http://container42.com/2013/12/16/persistent-volumes-with-docker-container-as-volume-pattern/">Data-only container pattern</a></p>

<p>If you are using the <code>busybox</code>, <code>scratch</code>, or
<code>&lt;insert minimally sized image here&gt;</code>, you are doing it wrong, and here&#39;s why.</p>
